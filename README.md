Convert a simple CLI game into a Web App

To see the evolution of the code view the commit history

The base CLI game was from [MIT 6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm) Problem Set solution. All other code is my own.

## Environment

- I am doing the tutorial in Python 3.6, 99% of the code will work in python 2.7+
- Highly recommend virtual environments and git
- I use PyCharm for the video tutorial. Use whatever you're comfortable with.

## What you should know

- Not python 101, but you don't need a vast amount of experience. If you can read python code this is for you.
- Might help to know a _little_ HTML and CSS. Bootstrap minimizes any CSS you need to know, but there will be some HTML.
